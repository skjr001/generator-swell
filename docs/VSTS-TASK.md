# VSTS Task
The VSTS Task project type gives you everything you need to add your own custom Build and/or Release tasks for [Visual Studio Team Services][vsts-url] (VSTS is a *free* end to end ALM platform, 
you should definitely check it out!). As with other project types, the generator will also give you all of the [boilerplate content][boilerplate-doc]. 
See the [high level usage overview][usage-overview-url] for more details about using the generator.
