# Boilerplate
All project types include all of the content outlined below. You can choose the first option 'New App with just the boilerplate' for the project type 
if you only want these files. See the [high level usage overview][usage-overview-url] for more details.

## Directory Structure & Files
The generator will create the following boilerplate directory structure and files for you. Note that if you pick a different project type, then the generator may
create additional files and/or directories for you. Also note that you won't have the 'node_modules' directory if you tell the generator to not install dependencies for your project.  
  
![Directory Structure][boilerplate-dir-image]  
  
See the below sections for detailed information about the [standard files][standard-section], [gulp tasks/building][building-section], [linting][linting-section],
[testing with mocha and istanbul][testing-section], [git hooks][git-hooks-section], and [npm scripts][npm-scripts-section].


## Standard Files
Naturally, the below common files are created for you. 

- .gitignore
- package.json
- README.md
- .npmignore
- tsconfig.json

## Gulp & Building
There is a gulpfile.js created in the root of the project directory, however, all of the gulp tasks are defined within the 'tasks' subdirectory within the 'build' directory. **Note** that we do NOT
recommend installing gulp globally, so most of these tasks are wrapped by an npm script ([details below][npm-scripts-section]) which allows them to be executed through npm without requiring gulp to be installed globally.

![Gulp Tasks][gulp-tasks-image]  
  
The configuration values for the various gulp tasks are contained with the files prefixed with '*-config.js'. The individual gulp tasks are contained within the respective files
under the 'tasks' directory. 

### Tasks

build.js

- *transpile*: Converts TypeScript to JavaScript.

clean.js

- *clean*: Removes the JavaScript files & maps generated by the transpilation process.

lint.js

- *jshint*: Executes jshint.
- *eslint*: Executes eslint.
- *tslint*: Executes tslint.

test.js 

- *_check-security_*: Runs the NSP utility to check for security issues.
- *pre-unit-tests*: Performs setup for executing unit tests. This task is more about clean task functions and should not be run in isolation
- *run-unit-tests*: Executes unit tests. 
- *enforce-code-coverage*: Uses istanbul to validate code coverage against thresholds defined in the istanbul-config.js file
- *show-unittest-coverage-report*: Opens the html code coverage report in the default browser. Use this to locally see a detailed line by line breakdown of code coverage, example below.

## Linting
The generator adds support for three linters to your project: [TSLint][tslint-url], [ESLint][eslint-url], and [JSHint][jshint-url]. The configuration files for these
can be found in the root of the project directory created by the generator. The recommended method for running these linters is via the [npm script outlined below][npm-scripts-section].

- *.eslintignore* - Specifies which files/directories to exclude from ESLint analysis.
- *.eslintrc.js* - Specifies the ESLint rule configuration to use for analysis.
- *.jshintignore* - Specifies which files/directories to exclude from JSHint analysis.
- *.jshintrc* - Specifies the JSHint rule configuration to use for analysis.
- *tslint.json* - Specifies the TSLint rule configuration to use for analysis.  
  
Note that the [Microsoft TSLint rules][tslint-microsoft-url] have been added to the TSLint rule configuration as well.  

## Testing
The generator creates the testing setup for your project with the following components: 

- [Mocha][mocha-url] - For the test framework/runner
- [Chai][chai-url] - For the assertion library
- [Sinon][sinon-url] - For stubs/mocks/spies/etc.
- [Istanbul][istanbul-url] - For code coverage, enforcement, and instrumentation

The recommended method for running tests and calculating code coverage is to use the [npm script outlined below][npm-scripts-section].  
  
By default, the tests use Mocha's TDD testing interface with a 3 second timeout, and leverage the [mocha-multi][mocha-multi-url] module to leverage the spec/stdout reporter as well
as the xunit reporter to write the test results to a file in the xunit format (which can be used to import/upload the results into certain CI/build tools). This configuration is defined
in the 'mocha-config.js' file within the 'build' directory.

### Coverage
Code coverage is calculated and enforced with [Istanbul][istanbul-url]. The values for the reporters, coverage thresholds, and more are defined in the file 'istanbul-config.js' 
within the 'build' directory.

## Git Hooks
The generator adds modules that allow you to leverage the client side [git hooks][git-hooks-url] in order to perform various validation steps. Currently, the generator configures
your project to leverage the 'pre-commit' hook. This will execute a series of steps, defined by you, that will automatically be performed prior to the git commit being finalized. 
This allows you do things like lint or run tests to verify your code changes prior to them being commited. This pre-commit step can be bypassed via a 
`git commit --no-verify` if desired. There is also a 'pre-push' hook if you would like to be able to execute these same types of validation steps prior to pushing your changes to the remote repo.
This can be done in addition to, or instead of, the pre-commit hook.

The steps that will be automatically executed are defined within the 'pre-commit' array in the generated package.json. The values in this array must represent the name of a script defined
within the npm scripts section in the package.json. The generator will set your initial configuration for the pre-commit hook to execute three of the npm scripts: check-security, 
enforce-code-coverage, and lint.

## NPM Scripts
npm scripts are a quick and convenient way to execute certain activities. We recommend leveraging these whenever and wherever possible. They are especially useful for dependencies local 
to the project, as it eliminates the need to install those globally and prevents needing to use hardcoded paths into the node_modules directory. 

Scripts can be executed via the shorthand:
```sh
npm run *script name*
```  
  
The generator creates the following npm scripts for your project:

- *build* - Single npm script that can be used to run all of your steps/tasks, such as during a build/CI process.
- *check-security* - Executes the NSP utility to check for security issues.
- *clean* - Removes the JavaScript files and maps generated by the transpilation process.
- *enforce-code-coverage* - Checks current code coverage against the defined thresholds.
- *gulp* - Wrapper around gulp so that individual gulp tasks can be executed without needing gulp installed globally. Usage would look like ```npm run gulp -- *gulp-task-name*```
- *lint* - Executes all of the linting engines.
- *show-unit-test-coverage* - Calculates the latest code coverage and displays the results in the default browser.
- *test* - Validates that current code coverage matches the thresholds and executes the NSP utility.
- *transpile* - Transpiles the TypeScript to JavaScript.
