# Boilerplate
All project types include all of the content outlined below. You can choose the first option 'New App with just the boilerplate' for the project type 
if you only want these files.

## Directory Structure & Files
The generator will create the following boilerplate directory structure and files for you. Note that if you pick a different project type, then the generator may
create additional files and/or directories for you. Also note that you won't have the 'node_modules' directory if you tell the generator to not install dependencies for your project.
